# Forestry Management, lowering complaints and work costs
Improving the NYC project to plant trees by showing problems with trees, their health, and preventative maintenance

## Data source
New York Open Data site. 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?Data-Collection_Data-Collection=Forestry+Management+System+(ForMS)
Data can also be accessed off Data.gov.

Tables are tree points, planting, service requests, inspections, risk assessment, work orders/ tree contract work, and tasks and a data dictionary is provided.

Tree condition is getting worse with fewer robust trees, yet numbers for lower grades of health are not showing that.

From the increase in work orders after the two high yellow lines decrease, resolving complaints by creating work orders and performing more block pruning may lower the amount of future work that needs to be done. This is a good long-term solution that keeps costs down predictably and keeps health levels up. Healthy, mature trees are best able to provide shade, cooling, water filtration, and aesthetics.

A third way to lower costs using current data is planting those species that have had lower amounts spent on them. This list of a few species out of 544 total orders from lowest amount spent to highest. Using this method to lower costs is short-sighted since the cheapest species are already used in abundance, up to 11% of the population. There would be a loss of diversity with effects like increased susceptibility to species-targeting problems like diseases. A good use of this list is to use less-planted species that have been shown to be easier to manage.
